        <h1>How Does Personal Banking Work?
        </h1>
        <h3>
           <h2> 1. Account Setup:</h2>

<h3>The first step in personal banking is to open up a bank account. Individuals can open savings accounts, which serve as the foundation for managing their funds. These accounts allow for deposits, withdrawals, and electronic transfers, facilitating daily financial transactions.</h3>

<h2>2. Deposits and Withdrawals:</h2>

<h3>Personal banking is all about providing easy access to your money. Clients can deposit their earnings, such as paychecks or other income sources, into their accounts. These funds are then readily available for withdrawal through various means, including ATM withdrawals, check-writing, or electronic transfers.</h3>

<h2>3. Access to Digital Tools:</h2>

<h3>Many personal banking institutions offer digital tools and platforms, such as online banking and mobile apps. These tools enable clients to monitor their account balances, review transaction history, pay bills, transfer money, and even set up automatic payments, making financial management efficient and convenient.</h3>

<h2>4. Security and Protection:</h2>

<h3>Personal banking institutions prioritize the security of clients’ financial assets. They employ encryption and security protocols to safeguard sensitive information and may offer insurance on deposits to protect against unforeseen events.</h3>
