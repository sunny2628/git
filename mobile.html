    <h2 align="center">MOBILE BANKING</h1>
    <h4>Mobile banking is an online banking service provided by banks to their existing customers to access their banking account for carrying out a myriad of transactions using a mobile device, including smartphone and tablet, whenever users are connected to the internet. 

        You can manage your finances on the go with a mobile banking application, which is easy and convenient in comparison to banking in person or on a computer, and doesn’t involve any fee for using the service. However, there can be connectivity issues, technical problems, and users will have to adhere to security guidelines.
        
        In this article, we will walk you through setting up a mobile banking application on your device, banking services you can access, as well as address security concerns to help you manage your banking needs.
    <h2>How to Use a Mobile Banking App?
    </h2>
   <h4>To use a mobile banking app from your smartphone or tablet, you need to download the application from the app store. Once the app is installed on your device, you need to add your bank account details for registration, followed by activation, and create an MPIN—which stands for mobile banking personal identification number—to login.</h4> 
<h3>Registration, activation, and login requirements to use a mobile banking app
</h3>
<h4>Depending on your bank with whom you have a savings account, there are primarily three ways of registration. This process is important for banks to recognize their existing customers.<br>
   <h4>The registration process is followed by activation, and this includes creating a mobile banking personal identification number (MPIN) — a four to six digit passcode required to access the banking account via mobile banking app. Once the MPIN is set up, you can proceed to login to access your banking account. Remember, you will be required to enter the MPIN each time you login to your mobile banking application.</h4> 
<h2>What can you do through a Mobile Banking App?
</h2>
<h4>Once you’ve logged in to your mobile banking app, the dashboard will give you a tour to help you use the mobile application. This includes where you can view your account balance, check statement, access debit card details, and many more. 

    Otherwise, you can take a peek into services by selecting tabs that are available on the dashboard, or use the search bar for specific queries. 
    
    Forbes Advisor India evaluated mobile banking applications of two major banking institutions of India to help you understand the type of banking, transaction, investment, and other services in the offing. However, the features may differ among banks providing mobile banking services.
